Code First: Girls

A little background on this wonderful company:
They offer free coding courses and events to young women across the country (mainly at universities) with the aim of seeing more women in tech!

In October I stumbled across a coding course specifically for girl. Now I've dabbled in coding (a little was required in uni, a little is required for my job and I have a general interest) but I've never been to formal lessons or spent a lot of time learning to code.

I applied to this course (which was quite a lot of work as it was short essay type questions - like what is your favourite startup and why?) not really expecting to get accepted; but I was pleasantly surprised.

Adding to my excitement the course was being taught at a startup accelator called L39 based in One Canada Square!!

Honestly, I wasn't expecting the course to be as good as it was. The instructors were great and friendly. The other girls were amazing and everyone helped each other and inspired each other (as cliqsted as that sounds).

I had never done any website development before, and after the 6 week course I was able to make this website (which I am ver proud of...) I am now relatively confident with my HTML and CSS skills, and I am starting to get the hang of Javascript and Jquery. And my plans are to make a few simple tutorials to add to my blog.

In a few short weeks, I will be taking the "Advanced" web design course which will be covering Python. Excited.
